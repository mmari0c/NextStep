For this sprint we focused on adding increased functionality through the calendar that allows users to set dates for applications and upcoming interviews on their calendar. We also improved on the design of the application overall, making it more palatable for other users. I’ve been focused on updating the design for the application to enhance the user experience. With the technical issues out of the way, such as merging on gitlab and downloading dependencies needed for our application to function, the major issue I have run into is knowing how to elaborate on the design of the application. We are in a good place and knowing how and where to further elaborate on our design has been the most challenging aspect for me. I have learnt about some website design, figuring out what is good on the eyes and can enhance the user experience. I have looked at how other companies design their website and small features that most users would not notice but add to the overall experience. Having buttons react on hover or maybe adding transition screens would make the experience less jarring and static. I think for future Sprints we can enhance our communication. Knowing what exactly we are working on and how tasks are distributed would further improve our flow of work. One of our main struggles is communicating effectively and distributing work amongst ourselves. This severely hinders progress as some of us are not sure what we are going to be focusing on for the next sprint and making sure we are not doubling up on work, effectively erasing someone else’s work.

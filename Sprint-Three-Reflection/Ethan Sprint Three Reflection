For this sprint I again had to learna about new features relating to website development, specifically about apis and their relation to 
website development. While my initial idea for the calendar was to build a dynamic for loop, this was quickly corrected by other sources.
I learned that apps had commonly used api services from major companies like Google to have features that might otherwise be redundant
or difficult to build. I learned about how these apps are connected to a framework such as Flask and some basic information about 
establishing this connection with the major service networks. While there are problems that arise that are unique to these new tools,
learning about both using and repairing api services during website development is likely going to be a valuable use of time for me to 
build up skill in the future. I am satisfied with what we have accomplished and I look forward to continuing to learn more
facets and features of website development.

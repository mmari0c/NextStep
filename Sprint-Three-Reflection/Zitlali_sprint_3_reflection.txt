Spring 3 reflection: 
During this sprint, I primarily focused on the front end of our program, which meant I started to look more into Bootstrap and some different features you could implement with it. This was my first time working with Bootstrap, so there was some trial and error that I had to get through, as well as having to look stuff up to use the program properly. I hope to continue to learn more about this tool and be able to use it more efficiently. As with any tool, learning something new can be difficult and bring challenges. My main challenge this spring was understanding how Bootstrap works and how to use it within a program. I still do not have a perfect understanding of it, but each time I use it I comprehend more and learn something new. Last spring I quickly learned some basic HTML and CSS and during this sprint, I continued to better my skills in those languages, but seeing that I've only been working with those languages for a few weeks I am still not too confident in coding in those languages which was another challenge I faced this sprint. Although I did not accomplish nearly as much as I hoped to during this sprint, I was able to contribute to our program by doing some individual tasks on the website, that added to the visuals. For this upcoming sprint, I am hoping to improve my front-end skills so that I can help make the website more visually appealing, and that will be my primary focus. Not only that, but I will continue to learn more about HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap on my own so that when I work on our project I will have learned more and I'll have better skills that will contribute to our group project.

During this sprint, the group primarily focused on setting up the calendar in 
the webpage and connecting it to the users google calendar, which would also be 
used to send the user reminders for any upcoming interviews they have. We also 
worked on the visuals of the website and made slight changes that made the 
website more appealing, such as changing the website's name, correctly aligning 
some headers, and displaying the users account in an organized frame. 

Our biggest roadblock during this sprint was having to figure out how to put a 
calendar in our website that would allow the user to view upcoming events. At 
first we tried putting a calendar in manually, but after struggling with that 
we found a google api that could connect the user's information from our 
program and display it in their google calendar.

Since the main priority this sprint was getting the calendar working and 
sending out reminders, we were not able to improve our websites visual as much 
as we had originally hoped to, especially with the roadblocks we encountered 
working on the calendar. That being said our client's main feedback point was 
improving the websites overall look, some examples they gave was adding more 
color instead of having a basic white page, and adding images/drawing/icons or 
something along those lines.

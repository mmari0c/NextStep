During this sprint, I focused heavily on improving the visual appeal of our web application.
In the previous sprint, we implemented significant functionality, but the design lacked the
polish we desired. This time, I aimed to enhance the user experience and make the interface
more visually appealing. One of my key contributions was revamping the table layout, which
initially appeared plain and unstructured. I redesigned it to improve both its aesthetics
and usability. Additionally, I implemented a new feature within the table that allows users to
update their application status to "Interview," "Rejected," or "Offer."

Another enhancement I worked on was improving error messaging. Previously, if users made a mistake,
they were redirected to a different route where an error message was displayed. In this sprint, I 
modified the behavior so that error messages now appear on the same route, streamlining the user experience.
 I also introduced an alert system to notify users when they successfully log in or make changes.

Beyond functionality, I rebranded the application, renaming it "NextStep" and adding a logo to the title
for a cohesive identity. I also merged the About and Contact pages into a single "About Us" page, which I
redesigned with a modern, clean aesthetic. While I’m proud of the progress, I still need to add our contact
information to this section.

The main challenge I encountered this sprint was working with CSS. It’s been a difficult tool for me to master.
While I often have a clear vision of the design I want to achieve, implementing it precisely as imagined has been
a struggle, often taking hours to complete seemingly simple changes. For example, creating the alert system and
designing the "About Us" page were particularly time-consuming. I originally envisioned a sliding page with images
and team information, but I couldn’t get it to display as desired.

This experience highlighted the need to improve my CSS skills and overall design capabilities. However, despite the
challenges, I’ve learned a great deal about CSS and explored tools like Bootstrap, which significantly simplify the
design process. Moving forward, I plan to continue honing my CSS skills and seek out additional resources to improve
both the efficiency and quality of my work.

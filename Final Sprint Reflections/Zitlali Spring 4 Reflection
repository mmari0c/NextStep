Sprint 4 was our last sprint for this project since the semester is coming to an end. Since it was so close to the end, most of the stuff that we wanted to implement had already been completed in the previous sprints. The only things that are left to do is to make the website be more visually appealing and clean up any possible bugs we find. If there is enough time we might add some extra features to the program but that is not our main goal as of right now. The biggest challenge I faced during this sprint did not have to do with programming, it was managing my time. Coming back from a week long break from school and having to go straight into studying for all my finals made it difficult for me to be able to manage my time in a way where I could contribute as much time as I had hoped for this sprint. This challenge only came from having a lot to do with not a lot of time, so for the last week of the semester I will be done with my finals so I will be able to work on the project since I'll have more free time.
Since this was the last sprint/week to work on the project, the main thing I wish to improve before the final week when we present our project is my ability to code in front-end languages. Not only that but I also want to be able to use some resources such as Bootstrap in a more resourceful manner than how I've been using them so far. After working on this project for a whole semester I have come to the realization that I prefer front-end development instead of back end so I will continue to work on those skills so they can help me in my career in the future.

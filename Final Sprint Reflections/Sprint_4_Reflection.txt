During this sprint, our team focused on making the website’s user interface more user-friendly and visually appealing. A key part of this effort was improving the front end to create a clean and attractive design. For example, we introduced an expanded tab feature that organizes information more effectively, making it easier for users to navigate. I'm happy to say that our team met these goals successfully, which is a great step forward in the project’s overall progress.

Achieving these objectives has provided a strong foundation for the next stages of development. Moving forward, we plan to refine the user experience further and add essential features that will enhance the website's functionality.

One of the biggest challenges I faced during this sprint was adding a calendar function to the website. This feature is crucial for scheduling and organizing events, but implementing it was far more complex than I expected. Integrating the calendar required understanding new libraries and managing data interactions between the backend and frontend. Debugging issues and ensuring that the calendar worked seamlessly with other parts of the site took a significant amount of time and effort.

Updating the user interface was another difficult task. Ensuring that the design looked polished while maintaining functionality meant balancing aesthetics with usability. Small changes in the layout sometimes caused unexpected issues, which had to be fixed without disrupting the rest of the website. Despite these obstacles, I am proud of the progress we made in creating a more engaging and intuitive interface.

Despite our successes as a team, I faced a few personal challenges during this sprint. One of the biggest difficulties was overcoming procrastination. Early on, I struggled with staying productive because we didn’t set weekly goals or have strict deadlines. As a result, I occasionally delayed tasks, which lowered my overall efficiency. Reflecting on this, I realize I need to improve my time management skills and develop better habits to stay consistently engaged in the project.

Looking ahead, I’m optimistic about what our team can achieve. While we’ve demonstrated that we work well together and can meet our objectives, there’s always room for improvement—particularly in sticking to deadlines and contributing regularly. I’m determined to improve my own productivity and help the team perform even better in future sprints.

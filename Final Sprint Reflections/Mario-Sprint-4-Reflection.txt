During this sprint, my contributions focused on making minor changes to improve the
visual appeal and usability of our web application. While the previous sprint emphasized
implementing functionality and a lot of the style of our page, we identified areas where
the design could be more polished. My efforts this time revolved around refining our code
and layout to create a better user experience.

Although these changes were incremental, they contributed to making the interface cleaner and more
user-friendly. I also made small design updates to our navigation bar and experimented with
implementing a "Resources" page, though it remains a work in progress.

One of the challenges I encountered was working with CSS. It continues to be a tool I find
difficult to master, as even seemingly simple changes often require significant effort to execute
correctly. For instance, while trying to style the "Resources" page and make visual tweaks across
the application, I struggled to align my designs with my original vision. This process sometimes
took longer than anticipated, which highlighted the need for improvement in my CSS skills.

Despite these challenges, I gained valuable insights into design and explored frameworks like
Bootstrap, which helped streamline some aspects of the styling process. Moving forward, I plan to
dedicate more time to improving my CSS proficiency and experimenting with additional design tools
to enhance both the quality and efficiency of my contributions.

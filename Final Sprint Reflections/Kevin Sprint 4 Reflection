For this sprint we were able to complete our platform to our user’s satisfaction. We got our platform to sync with google calendar and display it on our website. This way users can enter in job applications and set dates or reminders through google calendar. One of the major setbacks we came across was properly setting up permissions around google calendar. If the permissions were not enabled, then the calendars would not synch up and our website would not display anything. We have a working demo with an email that is properly set up to showcase the potential of our website. We finalized the design of the website, adding all our resource pages to help users with their job searching problems. Working as a team and properly communicating seems to have been our greatest struggle throughout this project. Ineffective communication really hindered our progress, but even so we were able to finish the platform. I think moving forward with future projects, establishing an effective line of communication will be crucial for the project’s success. Being able to effectively hand out tasks is important to enabling a steady workflow. If everyone knows what they are doing, there is less of a chance that someone will spend a sprint not knowing what to do or working over someone else’s work. Making sure everyone is on the same page is what enables a good team to cooperate and function smoothly. Without an effective line of communication, the progress of the project comes to a screeching halt and getting it back up and running seems to be an arduous task. Even so, the platform we have developed will allow users to have a centralized place to track their job applications and stay on top of future employment opportunities. This is the goal we set out to accomplish and this platform does just that.

During this sprint, our team focused on finalizing the remaining features and improving
the overall quality of the application. Our contributions revolved around two primary areas:
refining the visual design and completing the integration of the Google API functionality.

Improving its overall structure and user-friendliness, and some adjustments to the navigation
bar. Additionally, I worked on implementing a "Resources" page. Although the page is not yet
complete, the groundwork for its integration has been set and will be completed as soon as
tomorrow.

In terms of functionality, we finalized settings related to the Google API. These tools played a significant
role in our project, enabling us to implement features that would have otherwise required complex systems
or significant development effort. This experience not only added value to the application but also provided
me with hands-on knowledge that will be relevant in workplace scenarios. However, the API isn't working properly
right now, and need to make some final adjustments to it.

Beyond these accomplishments, we gained valuable experience in website development and explored alternative
strategies for implementing features efficiently. This sprint provided me with a strong foundation in web
development and a practical understanding of API integrations.

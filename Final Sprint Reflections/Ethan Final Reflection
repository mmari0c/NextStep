    For this final sprint I had to focus on finalizing the settings and functionality with the Google API. These
API tools are useful for creating functionality on a project that would otherwise take a complex system or a large 
amount of work to implement successfully. I am glad to have gained experience on this part of development as there
are several potential circumstances where this knowledge could be relevant in the workplace. I am glad for the 
opportunity to learn about not only website development, but the many possibilities and alternative strategies as well.
Now, in future projects and work, I will have a a strong foundation of website development knowledge as well as a good frame
of reference for working efficiently.

I learned a few things during this sprint, one of the main things I learned was how to properly use GitLab and successfully connect it to my computer, which was long awaited but it is now a very useful tool to have. Another skill that I acquired during this sprint was that I learned the basics of two new programming languages, HTML and CSS. I had limited time to learn them so I am not an expert in either of the languages yet but I am learning more every day with the practice I get from working on the project. Both of these skills/tools are going to be very helpful for me in the future, not just in this class but in my career as well.
The main challenge I faced during this sprint was having to code in languages I had never used before. I had to quickly teach myself those languages to be of help to the team, so I started watching YouTube videos and going on different websites to try to get a good understanding of the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. 
Something that I believe can be improved for the next sprint will be the way the work is being divided, this will be something the whole team will have to work on. I will try to do more work on our program in future sprints because sometimes I feel that I can contribute more than I currently do. In my previous sprint reflection (for sprint 1), one of the challenges I faced was procrastination, however, for this sprint I feel that it wasn't an issue. When my team wanted to have a feature done by a certain date, I made sure to have my work completed by that time. As previously mentioned, during this sprint I was able to get more familiar and comfortable with the programming languages HTML and CSS, and that was because for this sprint I focused more on the front end of the website. I was able to design a few features of the website into a nicer design and will continue to focus on that.

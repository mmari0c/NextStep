During this sprint we have fully realized our account creation system and begun development on our job tracking system. Users can now enter our application, register and log in into their account, and begin entering their job applications onto their account. All of this is stored in our database and persists when the user returns. I developed the layout for the table presenting the jobs entered by users and helped the the layout of the table present in the profile page. This mainly focused on stylizing the table to better fit our design. We will continue to iterate on our design to present jobs being tracked  by the user in a more appealing way. During this sprint I face the challenge of a merge error after I was done with my part. After we started implementing our database, merges between database changes caused fatal errors to the application. These changes were committed but not pushed and I had to figure out how to revert these changes before any push occurred to protect the working code on the repository. Ultimately, my work had been undone but I was able to implement it quickly without damaging the database upon merging. I gained some more insight into how to properly use all features available through git. More specifically, what files should be untracked, not included, or any changes reverted before committing and pushing any changes. This ensures smooth implementation without constant merges causing errors difficult to correct. I think for future sprints and development our team can continue to work communicating and establishing a direction with the application. There are many conflicting ideas presented either for future ideas or how features should actually be implemented. This will lead to a smoother and quicker development process as we can be sure on our vision for the application and no code will be reverted due to the entire team not being on the same page.

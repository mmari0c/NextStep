In this sprint, I contributed significantly to our project’s development. I implemented a feature that
allows a users to change their password if they forget it. Additionally, I secured parts of our application by creating
a function that restricts access to logged-in users only. I also set up the database to store usernames and hashed
passwords upon signup, providing a secure foundation for user authentication. To support session management, I added a
logout feature. One of my most important contributions was developing the core job-tracking functionality, enabling users
to log and view their job applications in a portfolio format.

While I didn’t face major individual challenges, it was initially difficult for our team to collaborate due to GitLab 
connectivity issues in VS Code, which delayed some of our workflows. Thankfully, we resolved these technical issues and
were able to collaborate effectively afterward.

Throughout this sprint, I gained practical skills in SQL, as well as some foundational knowledge
in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. This project is also my first exposure to web development with Python and Flask, so I’m learning
the ropes as I go. While I’m excited by the progress, I recognize that there is much to improve on, especially in front-end
development. I’d like to build stronger skills in HTML, CSS, and, notably, JavaScript, to make our application more dynamic.
Much of our current design is static, so one of our primary goals for the next sprint is to enhance interactivity by implementing
JavaScript features.

Looking ahead, another main objective of mine is to expand functionality by allowing users to edit the status of their job applications and
receive email notifications for upcoming interviews. This will not only improve user engagement but also make the app more helpful
for tracking and organizing job application processes.

During this sprint, the team and I made considerable progress on our project’s functionality and user experience.
We successfully set up a database to store user information, including personal details, usernames, and hashed passwords,
allowing secure login capabilities. We implemented a password reset feature for users who forget their login credentials,
enhancing the site's usability. Additionally, we began working on the core functionality of our project: tracking job applications.
Users can now enter their job application details, which are stored and displayed in a portfolio format. Though it is currently in
a static state, we plan to build on this foundation to make the portfolio more interactive and personalized.

To add value beyond the basics, we’ve expanded user registration to include fields for personal and job-related information. This
data will contribute to the analytics aspect of our project, where users can later visualize their career progression. While the
design remains minimal, the team and I have started exploring CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to improve the website’s appearance
and interactivity.

A primary challenge this sprint was establishing a smooth workflow with GitLab and VS Code. Due to network restrictions on campus 
machines, many of us had difficulty connecting the two, which initially hindered our collaboration. After troubleshooting, we
resolved these issues and were able to work effectively as a team.

Our stakeholder was pleased with the functionality we’ve implemented, especially considering that most of us are relatively new
to web development. However, she expressed concerns about the website’s visual presentation, noting that it felt too bland with
an excess of white space. She recommended adjusting the borders and adding more color to improve aesthetics. Specifically, she
suggested enhancements to the homepage and portfolio, such as adding a border to the portfolio table and making it interactive.
Additionally, she requested a more welcoming contact page with brief bios and possibly photos of each team member to establish
a stronger connection with users.

Based on this feedback, our focus in the next sprint will shift toward improving the website’s visual appeal. We’ll work to
fill empty spaces, introduce colors and borders, and refine the overall layout to provide a more engaging and user-friendly
experience. This emphasis on design will help us deliver a product that is not only functional but also inviting and visually
appealing to users.

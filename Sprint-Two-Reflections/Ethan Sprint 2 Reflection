During this sprint we focused on furthering the existing foundation of our website. I
have successfully added a profile page feature this sprint, which works as an extension
of our database and login/registering features. This profile page will likely look
different in future versions of the project, but what we do have is a framework
that allows us to track the history of changes to the profile while only displaying
the most recent entry. A large part of the creation of our project has been modularity
and ensuring that the parts we make will be able to be applied and expanded as the 
development continues.

I have also created UML documentation for our group to allow for a quick understanding
of our flow and priotities at a glance. We have all worked now to lay down the groundwork
for the rest of our project, and I will soon begin figuring how we want to implement the
sheduling of the job interviews. This will be the next major accomplishment for our group,
and I will be using my work on the website to easily adapt to these new ideas.

I have been able to continue my learning about Python/Flask, CSS, and especially SQL
databases. This type of knowledge will be very useful for future jobs and projects.
While we may not work with Flask specifically in the future, knowing how SQL databases
operate and being able to work with them will be very useful for learning later 
coding techniques. I am excited to continue developing our project and make a final
product we will be proud of.

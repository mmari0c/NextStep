For this sprint we focused on learning
a new framework in Python. I spent a 
lot of time during the sprint learning
about Flask, HTML, and Python, which 
has been a good example for website 
development during future opportunities.


We were unable to complete any of the User
Stories directly, as they required complex
code that we are working up to. We have,
however, created a strong framework that 
will allow us to have an easy time with
future development. We look forward to 
enhancing our knowledge about website
development during the next sprint,
where we aim to handle the User Stories
related to account management.

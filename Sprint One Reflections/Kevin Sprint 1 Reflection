For our first sprint our team’s main goal was to get a barebones program down. We were able to accomplish our goal as we got a basic UI for our website down with a log in feature. The UI was put down to have something we can see and work off. We have not yet finalized the pages and design for the website. I am currently working on the design for the website. Having something more round and less angular can give the website a more welcoming feel to users. However, having something too “bubbly” could give the impression that the website is more for kids. Achieving a balance is crucial as our target audience is college students that must manage internship and job interviews. Of course, this will be usable by anyone for management purposes. Getting started was one of our main challenges as we were unfamiliar with what sort of code needs to be written. We have researched a few tools to get started and are now understanding how the building blocks go together. We have many planned features that we know can be done, but we lack the knowledge on how to implement them. For example, we found a python web development tool that has allowed us to integrate a log in feature. During the lecture we also learnt of a possible way to integrate notifications through SMS gateways, especially if this project is going to be a website platform. Moving forward, I think something we can improve is communicating with one another what we are going to be working on. Even with user stories, getting something barebones was difficult since sometimes two or three people would decide they were going to work on something only to find out someone else is currently working on it. This would definitely increase our productivity as having everyone working on separate things would be more beneficial than having people wondering what they are going to work on.

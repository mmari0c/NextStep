During this sprint, our primary focus was on developing the foundational framework for our project.
This framework, now available on our GitLab repository, will serve as the backbone for our future
development efforts. The process of setting up this structure required a significant amount of time
dedicated to learning new tools and frameworks, specifically Flask and how it interacts with Python.
As a result, we conducted in-depth research into Python’s virtual environments and deployment processes,
areas that were previously unfamiliar to us.

Because so much time was devoted to understanding the technical mechanics behind creating an initial website,
progress on some of the more complex stories for this sprint was slower than anticipated. Many of these tasks
require more advanced code, which depends on having a more complete website structure in place. Nevertheless,
we succeeded in building a functional framework that will guide our work for the rest of the semester. As we 
move forward, we will continue learning new techniques and improving our implementation strategies.

Our biggest roadblock during this sprint was the team's varied levels of experience with web development and
the disparity in knowledge among group members. This made it challenging for everyone to work at the same pace,
but it also motivated us to spend extra time learning the necessary technologies. We are committed to ensuring
that each team member gains the required skills to successfully contribute to building the website system. Our
demo was a valuable exercise, as it provided us with a working example of the website’s origin and allowed us to
receive initial feedback.

Although we presented a demo to our client, the first sprint was primarily focused on learning new technology
and setting up the website’s structural framework. Because of this, the feedback we received wasn’t as comprehensive
or actionable as we hoped. However, in the next sprint, our focus will shift toward implementing the core features of
the project, and we expect to receive more detailed and constructive feedback from our client at that time.

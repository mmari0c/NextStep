Most of the backend programming done for this project is written in python, and I had yet to code anything in python so I had to reach out for help a lot more than I would have liked. However, after a while I was able to pick it up quicker and did not need to ask for as much help as I did in the beginning. 
There were a few roadblocks during this first print, however I feel that one of the biggest challenges I faced during this sprint was procrastination. Seeing that it was the first sprint, and we didnâ€™t have weekly assignments to turn in, I would get lazy sometimes and put off working on the project. Having to get used to not having any supervision and instead finally growing up and working on my own time without someone telling me to do so, was an experience I have not experienced but am grateful for. 
Although I have used git before for one other class, I had never fully understood it and would just copy and paste my work onto the main branch instead of pushing it. During this sprint, I was able to do some more research on git and improve my understanding of it. 
As previously mentioned, a challenge that I had during this sprint was procrastination, so for this next sprint I hope to be able to focus more and complete tasks in the sprint in a timely manner. Not only that but I will also be improving my ability to program in the language python, because this is my first time using that programming language.
